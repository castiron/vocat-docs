# Evaluator

The **EVALUATOR** user role is given to the instructor of a class that is
utilizing the VOCAT system. The following portion of the documentation seeks to
make the facets of this user role as direct and clear as possible.

### Dashboard

This is the first page you will arrive at after logging in. It displays an
overview of your courses with submission and scoring data for each.

<img style="border:1px solid black" src="content_assets/evaluator/dash.png" height="97%" width="97%">

You can navigate to your course from the course selection menu in the top left
corner of the page, or by clicking on the course title in the Dashboard.

The Dashboard also provides links to course projects and recently added videos,
which you can click to proceed directly to those pages.

### Course View

When you enter a course, you will see the œôòüEvaluationsœôòı grid featuring student
names aligned vertically down the left side and assignments aligned horizontally
across the top. (Group assignments can be seen in a similar grid by clicking
the **œôòüGroupsœôòı** radio button above the list of student names.)

### Creating Projects

<!-- CURRENT STOPPING POINT NOV 10 -->

To create a new assignment in your course, make sure you have clicked through to the Course View.
From there, click on the course name at the top of
the page, then click œôòüProjectsœôòı located under "SETUP YOUR COURSE" in the expanded
menu that appears. 

<img style="border:1px solid black" src="content_assets/evaluator/create_proj.png" height="97%" width="97%">

Here you can
either edit existing projects (if you have them) by clicking the project name,
or you can create a new project by clicking the **œôòüNEW PROJECT +œôòı** button.

<img style="border:1px solid black" src="content_assets/evaluator/new_proj.png" height="97%" width="97%">

When creating a new project: give it a short name that distinguishes it from
other assignments in your course, write a brief description of the project in
the œôòüDescriptionœôòı field, and select a rubric from the rubrics dropdown menu if
you are planning to score videos within Vocat.

<img style="border:1px solid black" src="content_assets/evaluator/proj_desc.png" height="97%" width="97%">

In the œôòüWho can create a submission for this project?œôòı dropdown menu, choose
œôòüIndividualœôòı if it is an individual project, œôòüGroupœôòı if it is a group project,
and œôòüBothœôòı if it could be either. This just determines whether the
project shows up in the œôòüStudentsœôòı grid or the œôòüGroupsœôòı grid on the Evaluations
page.

<img style="border:1px solid black" src="content_assets/evaluator/ind_proj.png" height="97%" width="97%">

Next, select a due date (or presentation date if filmed in class), and click the
**œôòüSAVE PROJECTœôòı** button.

<img style="border:1px solid black" src="content_assets/evaluator/save_proj.png" height="97%" width="97%">

When you click "Evaluations" at the top of the page, you will now see this
assignment in the grid.

<img style="border:1px solid black" src="content_assets/evaluator/proj_proof.png" height="97%" width="97%">

<p id="groups"></p>

<p></p>

### Creating Groups

If you have group assignments, first make sure the project youœôòùve created has
been set to œôòüGroupsœôòı or œôòüGroups and Usersœôòı <a href="#projects">(see above
section)</a>. You can check this by clicking the Groups button above the list
of student names, and seeing if the assignment appears in the group Evaluations
grid.

To create new groups, go to **Manage Course > Groups**.

Click the **œôòüADD GROUP +œôòı** button to create a new group. It will automatically be
named œôòüGroup #1œôòı but you can rename it by clicking the group title at the top of
the page. If you change group titles, be sure to click the orange œôòüClick here to
save your changesœôòı notice that appears above the group list.

If you want to create random groups, simply click the the **œôòüADD GROUP +œôòı** button
repeatedly until youœôòùve created the number of groups you want, then click the
**œôòüAUTO ASSIGN TO GROUPS >œôòı** button, and the class will be split up evenly into
those groups.

### Evaluations

Clicking œôòüEvaluationsœôòı at the top of the page will take you back to the
Evaluations grid. This grid pattern allows you to quickly see three things
about each assignment:

1.     Whether or not a video has been uploaded for a particular student,
denoted by the green œôòüplayœôòı button in a circle.
2.     The assignment grade (in percent), if given.
3.     Whether or not the score has been published so that the student can see
it.

Clicking on any of these items will take you into the studentœôòùs video page for
that particular project.

<p id="videos"></p>

---

<p></p>

### Uploading Videos

From the Evaluations grid, click on the gray œôòüPlayœôòı icon corresponding to the
student and project that you want to upload a video for. This will take you to
that studentœôòùs page for that specific assignment. (For groups, do the same, but
in the Groups evaluation grid.)

You should see an empty, green media frame with a button in the center that
reads: **ADD A VIDEO TO THIS SUBMISSION**. Click this button.

This gives the creator the following options: **UPLOAD A VIDEO, ADD A YOUTUBE
VIDEO, ADD A VIMEO VIDEO,** and **BACK**.

1. Click the **UPLOAD A VIDEO** button
2. If the video is easily accessible on your desktop, you can simply click
on it with your mouse, hold, and drag into the box. <font color="red">(Note:
This feature only works in Google Chrome.)</font>
3. You can also click **DRAG AND DROP OR CLICK TO SELECT A VIDEO FILE**, and a
file system interface should appear, allowing you to select the video from the
folder in which you have it stored.
4. Once you select the video for upload, the upload process begins and you
will see a spinning icon. <font color="red">It is important that you do not
close the browser tab or go to another web page while this is happening. </font>
You may work in other tabs or other programs, though.
5. When the file is done uploading from your computer, you will see a
notification telling you to check back in 5-10 minutes while the video
processes. At this point, you are free to exit the page or upload a video for
another student.

<p></p>

### Annotations

The annotation tool allows you to make specific comments about points in the
studentœôòùs presentation, and automatically logs the time in the video at which
the annotation is composed. When you see something you want to annotate during
playback, simply type the note in the text box that reads **œôòüEnter a video
annotationœôó¦œôòı** just below the video screen.

The video will automatically pause when you begin typing, and will resume when
you press enter to submit the annotation. Students can also annotate their own
videos as a way of analyzing their performance.

<p id="scoring"></p>

<p></p>

### Scoring

Under the studentœôòùs video you will see the **œôòüSCORESœôòı** header and a button
that says **œôòüCreate a New Evaluation.œôòı**

Clicking that button will expand the rubric to show sliders for each criteria.
You can either drag the sliders to the desired scores with your mouse, or click
the number on the right side and type in your scores. The meter at the top of
the rubric will automatically update with the total percentage score.

You can save your evaluation at any time by clicking the **œôòüSave Evaluationœôòı**
button on the right side. The status icon to the left shows whether the rubric
is published or unpublished.

By default, the score is unpublished, meaning it is not available to the
student. If you click the icon that says **œôòüUnpublished,œôòı** it will change the
status to **œôòüPublished.œôòı**

### Discussions

Students and instructors can also post comments in the discussion section,
which appears at the bottom of the video page. The commenting feature allows
you to post new comments or reply to existing ones, making it easy to follow
the flow of the discussion.

<p id="settings"></p>

<p></p>

### Settings

If you select **Manage Course > Settings** from the menu at the top of the
course page, you can open up several visibility, discussion, and evaluation
options to your students.

* **œôòüEnable public discussionœôòı** allows everyone in the class to see each
otherœôòùs videos and comment on them. By default, students can only see their own
videos.
* **œôòüEnable peer reviewœôòı** allows students to see each otherœôòùs videos and grade
them on the rubric that is attached to the project (if there is one).
* **œôòüAllow self-evaluationœôòı** offers students the option of assessing their own
video on the rubric that is attached to the project.
* **œôòüAllow creators to upload videosœôòı** offers students the ability to upload
their own videos to the system. This means that you can create out-of-class
assignments and students can upload videos from their own computers.

<p id="rubrics"></p>

<p></p>

### Rubrics

To create or edit rubrics, click the **œôòüMy Rubricsœôòı** link at the top of the page.
This brings you to a screen with rubrics youœôòùve created under the œôòüYOUR RUBRICSœôòı
header, as well as some system-wide rubrics under œôòüVOCAT RUBRICS.œôòı

If one of the system-wide rubrics is similar what you want, you can create an
editable version in your own rubric library by clicking the **œôòüSelect an Actionœôòı**
button to the right of the rubric name, then clicking **œôòüClone Rubric.œôòı**

To create a rubric from scratch, click the **œôòüNew Rubric +œôòı** button at the top
right corner of the page.

1. Give your rubric a name and brief description in the œôòüRubric Nameœôòı and
œôòüDescriptionœôòı fields.
2. In œôòüLowest Possible Scoreœôòı and œôòüHighest Possible Score,œôòı enter the lowest
and highest scores possible for ***each criteria you will be grading on***, not
the total score possible in the rubric.
3. Click the **œôòüAdd Criteria +œôòı** button and enter the first item that you will
be assessing, then click the **œôòüSaveœôòı** button. Repeat this step until all of
your criteria are entered.
  * Note: Vocat does not currently support weighted rubrics. As a workaround,
  you can create multiple criteria that are actually assessing the same thing.
  For example, if you have a 10-point rubric, you can make œôòüOrganizationœôòı worth
  30 points by creating three criteria: œôòüOrganization 1-10,œôòı
  œôòüOrganization 11-20,œôòı and œôòüOrganization 21-30.œôòı
  * If a student scores 25 out of 30 on Organization, give them 10 out of 10 on
  the Organization 1-10 criteria, 10 out of 10 on Organization 11-20, and 5 out of
  10 on Organization 21-30.
4. Click the **œôòüAdd Range +œôòı** button and enter a name for your lowest scoring
range, then repeat for the next lowest and so on, until you have entered all
your scoring ranges (poor, average, and excellent, for example). You can rename
a range or criteria at any time just by clicking on its name.
5. To edit the points that each scoring range encompasses, use the œôòüRUBRIC
SCORE RANGESœôòı slider above your list of criteria and ranges.
6. When youœôòùve completed your rubric, click the **œôòüSave >œôòı** button, and it
will show up in your rubric list.
