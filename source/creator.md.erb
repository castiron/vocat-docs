### Creating New Video Submissions

From the dashboard a creator can choose to specify a single class using the left-top corner dropdown, or the creator can choose to remain on the dashboard where all class assignments can be viewed. If the student has not yet created a video submission for an enrolled in class, there will appear on the dashboard a frame with a notice that reads **Visit Submission Page to Upload Attachment**, signaling to the creator
that no video has been uploaded.

<!--ADD FIRST VID IMAGE-->

From here the creator should click on the project title, or the  **Visit Submission Page to Upload Attachment** notice.  This action will take the user to a page with several light-gray boxes, the first of
which has a button in the middle that reads **Add a Video to This Submission**. By clicking
on this button, a series of options appear, allowing the creator to choose a method by which
to upload his or her video submission.

<!--ADD SECOND VID IMAGE-->

<!--You should see an empty, light-gray media frame with a button in the center that
reads: **ADD A VIDEO TO THIS SUBMISSION**. Click this button.-->

The following options are given when **Add a Video to This Submission** is clicked: **UPLOAD A VIDEO,
ADD A YOUTUBE VIDEO, ADD A VIMEO VIDEO,** and **BACK**.

*NOTE: The following instructions involve uploading an original video.
<a href="record_upload.html#youtube">CLICK HERE</a> for YouTube and Vimeo instructions.*

1. Click the **UPLOAD A VIDEO** button
2. If the video is easily accessible on your desktop, you can simply click
on it with your mouse, hold, and drag into the box. <font color="red">(Note:
This feature is still under development, may not work in all browsers.)</font>
3. You can also click **DRAG AND DROP OR CLICK TO SELECT A VIDEO FILE**, and a
file system interface will appear, allowing you to select the video file from the
folder in which said file is stored.
4. Once you select the video for upload, the upload process begins and you
will see a new button that says **Upload in progress**. <font color="red">It is important that you do not
close the browser tab or go to another web page while this is happening. </font>
You may work in other tabs or other programs, though.
5. When the file is done uploading from your computer, you will see a
notification button that reads **Processing Video. Check back in 5-10 minutes.**.
At this point, you are free to exit the page.

### Upload to VOCAT servers

If the creator chooses to upload a video directly to VOCAT, it should be kept in mind that the video format must be **AVI, FLV, MP4,** or **MPEG-2**. Maximum size of a video must be less than 1MB. After clicking **UPLOAD A VIDEO** button you will be given the option to **DRAG AND DROP OR CLICK TO SELECT A VIDEO FILE**. A user can simply drag a video file into this box, and the uploading process will begin, or the creator can click the button that these options are written on, which will bring up a local file selection interface. You will have to wait for a moment as your video is transcoded, but after this process your video should be ready to view.

### Annotations

Both the creator and evaluator have the ability to annotate video submissions.
The annotation tool freezes playback when the user begins typing in the text box
beneath the **ADD AN ANNOTATION** header.  VOCAT automatically logs the time at which
the annotation is composed, and dynamically returns to the video's annotation-point when
the annotation is clicked.

### Scores

The creator can examine scores given to them by their evaluator. a thermometer-style visualization reports the percentage out of 100. If the creator clicks on this visualization more rubric detail appears below, giving more clarity to the evaluator’s critique.

### Discussions

Creators can also engage in a discussion section that supplements each submitted video. A textbox appears under the DISCUSSIONS header. This allows for feedback and communication between creator-evaluator and/or creator-creator.
