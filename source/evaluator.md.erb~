### Creating New Projects

When a class is selected new options appear on the menu bar below the course selection drop-down. The next step in developing your class’ VOCAT instance is creating a new assignment or project. This can be accomplished by clicking the newly available **MANAGE COURSE** selection. From there the evaluator can click **Projects** from the dropdown:

### Editing Course Settings

Found beneath the Manage Course menu in the top-left corner, the **EDIT COURSE SETTINGS** page allows the
evaluator to communicate a course message. This page also gives the evaluator access to **COURSE CONFIGURATION** at the lower half of the screen. This allows:

 - Enabling public discussion
 - Enabling peer review
 - Allowing creators to upload video
 - Allowing self-evaluation

After evaluator has customized these options appropriately, the **SAVE SETTINGS** button is located at the bottom-left corner of the page.

### Utilizing Rubrics

 * To create a new rubric or to use an already existing rubric click My Rubrics on the upper-left side of the page.
 * To create a rubric click on the green button **NEW RUBRIC** on the upper-right side.

From the Rubrics Management Page you can create new rubrics, view all rubrics on your VOCAT instance, or click into existing rubrics for editing. You can also choose to make them “public,” which will make them available to other Vocat evaluators for cloning and modification. To make a Vocat rubric public, click into the rubric, click “Modify,” and then select “Yes” from the “Is this a system-wide rubric?” dropdown menu.

### My Rubrics (Create New Rubric)


 * To create a rubric or to use an already existing rubric click on My Rubrics on the upper-left side of the page.
 * To create a new rubric click on the green button titled NEW RUBRIC on the upper-right side.
 * To use an existing rubric, navigate to VOCAT RUBRICS, select CLONE option

To create a rubric click on the green tab “New Rubric” on the upper right side.

Enter the name and description of the rubric. Try to be as specific as you can, especially if this will be a public rubric, available to all Vocat users in the instance.

Enter the lowest possible and highest possible scores for scoring criteria for your rubric. The default is set at 0-100 but you can change it to whatever best suits your needs.

Add as many scoring criteria as you wish by clicking the **ADD CRITERIA** button at the bottom of the screen. The criteria are what you are evaluating; common criteria include “Eye Contact,” “Use of Visual Aids,” “Clarity of Speech,” etc. Once you’ve entered the criteria, you can navigate them with the two arrows on the bottom left of the screen.

For each critera, define the score ranges by clicking the **ADD RANGE** button. Give each range a name. Typical range names are “High,” “Medium,” “Low” or “Excellent,” “Very Good, “Good,” “Fair,” “Poor,” etc.

Begin with the lowest range (“Low”) and work your way up to the highest (“High”). As you add ranges, Vocat will calculate the score ranges based on the highest possible and lowest possible scores you defined earlier. You can adjust the scores for each range with the “Rubric Score Ranges” slider.

For each criteria you’ve defined, enter a detailed description by clicking on the range name under the criteria name (“Excellent Eye Contact,” “Good Eye Contact,” etc.) Try to be as specific and as thorough as possible. These descriptions should make it clear to all using the rubric how to differentiate, for example, between “Good Eye Contact,” “Fair Eye Contact,” and “Poor Eye Contact.”

When you are finished. Save your rubric by clicking on the SAVE RUBRIC button below the slider.
