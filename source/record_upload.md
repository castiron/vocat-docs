There are three suggested ways to record videos for use on the VOCAT 3 system: iPhone/iPad “Camera” app, Android “Camera” app, or some kind of flip-camera style recording device (devices available in [the library](http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/library/students/techloan.html))

 * Once you connect with USB save the video file to your computer in one of the following formats: AVI, FLV, MP4 or MPEG-2.

### **IV. Uploading to Vimeo**
(Vimeo uploading instructions pulled from: [http://www.steves-digicams.com/knowledge-center/how-tos/online-sharing-social-networking/how-to-upload-videos-to-vimeo.html](http://www.steves-digicams.com/knowledge-center/how-tos/online-sharing-social-networking/how-to-upload-videos-to-vimeo.html):

#### Step 1: Log Into Your Account
---

The first thing that you should do is visit the Vimeo website. If you already have an account, log into it by clicking the login link. If you don't have an account, then you will need to register. Follow the instructions and enter the necessary information to create your account.

#### Step 2: Uploading the Video
---

Click the "Upload Video" button which is located on the home page of the site. You will also be able to find the same link in the navigation bar which is under the Upload heading.

#### Step 3: The Upload Page
---

Once you click the upload link, you will be taken to the upload page. This can be confusing at times. You need to read through this and follow the directions. You will need to ensure that you are permitted to upload the videos you are interested in.

You will only be able to upload videos that you create yourself. It's not possible to upload any videos that are copyrighted or owned by anyone else.

#### Step 4: Selecting the File
---

Click the "Choose a File to Upload" button and this will launch an upload dialog box. Choose the file that you want to upload and then click on "Select". As soon as you click the button, the video will start to be uploaded straight away. The progress bar should estimate how long the video will take to be uploaded.

If you are using a slow Internet connection, then you will find it takes longer to upload. Just be patient and allow the video to be fully uploaded. If there are any problems with the uploaded video, then you will need to repeat the process and upload it a second time.

#### Step 5: Conversion
---

As soon as the video is uploaded, the video will then be converted automatically. You can close this page if you want, and Vimeo will handle the conversion automatically.Once the video has finished converting, the service will then email you once the conversion has finished.

#### Step 6: Using the Desktop Uploader
---

If you are interested in uploading lots of files, then you will need to use the desktop uploader. This is optional, but will make uploading files much simpler.

Click the download button to download the uploader to your computer. Accept the license details, and save the file on your computer. Follow all the instructions to install the application on your computer. This will then walk you through the process of uploading files to the service.
